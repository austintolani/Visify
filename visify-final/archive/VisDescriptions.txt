Spider Chart
This chart displays what percentile your top songs place in among all songs in spotify. In pink is the average of all your songs, in blue is the song you have selected.
These statistics danceability, acousticeness, valence, and energy were created by spotify and are scaled on from 0 to 1
While the fastest tempo song is just over 1000, the highest among modern, popular songs are under 200. Thus this statistic was scaled 0 to 200
Here is what each statistic means:
Danceability - describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity.
Acousticeness - A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic
Energy - a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy.
Valence - A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).
